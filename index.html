    <h1>This is a privacy policy for NYT Crossword Clue Hider</h1>
    <h4>For the record, NYT Crossword Clue Hider a Chrome extension, roughly 50 lines of code, which adds a button that lets you hide or show the clues you've already answered in the NYT crossword. I made it because my boyfriend and I were tired of having to scroll up to see the all the clues.</h4>
    <h4>It is not collecting your data. It has absolutely no reason to collect your data. You can view the entire source code here: <a href="https://github.com/contrabanjo/NYT-Crossword-Clue-Hider">https://github.com/contrabanjo/NYT-Crossword-Clue-Hider</a>
    </h4>
    <h2>Why does it need a privacy policy?</h2>
    <h3>Google made me add one to publish this in the Chrome store. I don't know why. It's weird that this is a standard thing for developers now. Weird that we live in a world where we have to add a legal document to 50 lines of code that makes it slightly less annoying to do the crossword. </h3>
    <h3>Anyway, here's a privacy policy:</h3>
    <h2>NYT Crossword Clue Hider does not and will never collect personal information.</h2>
    <h2>Please never use a crossword clue hider that asks you to disclose personal information.</h2>
    <h2>That's weird.</h2>
